	<h3>Welcome to the UYIFL</h3>
                The UYIFL is excited to bring FULL CONTACT  youth football indoors each Spring! 
                The UYIFL brings our youth inside to further develop and enhance their outdoor football skills! 
                We play on an Arena Football size field, but to keep it consistent for the players, we play 11 on 11 for the younger players, and 8 on 8 for the older with the same rules as outdoors (with a few minor adjustments for field size)!! Teams get 7 regular season games, then playoffs and Indoor War Bowl!
                Coaches and parents of our Spring UYIFL players have noticed greatly enhanced skills, better conditioning,  and more enthusiasm going into their Fall programs! 
                Our games are played at the Spence Eccles Fieldhouse (UofU indoor practice facility) at 650 So. Guardsman Way (1580 E).
