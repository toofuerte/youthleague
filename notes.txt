dbl::ok, your page is http://utahyifl.appspot.com/
also, if you go to http://utahyifl.appspot.com/registration
the java file uyifl.servlets.Registration is hit and run
(the relationship between url and java class is 
defined in war/WEB-INF/web.xml)

dbl::notice that i did make a small change to your reg.html
so that it pointed to /registration

dbl::we need to start making a pojo
(plain old java object) for the registration form
if you have time start adding data "fields"
to uyifl.pojos.RegForm

dbl::right now the app *MAY* be saving a little bit of info to the db
i think just first name, last name and some phone numbers
i dont have time to confirm it

dbl::the dashboard for the app is located at 
https://appengine.google.com/dashboard?&app_id=utahyifl
the idea is that in the dashboard you could open the 
datastore viewer to see the objects in there

gda::I have put in fields in the pojo. make sure things are right.  
I was wondering if there is a way to set up to take payments?
