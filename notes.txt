dbl::ok, your page is http://utahyifl.appspot.com/
also, if you go to http://utahyifl.appspot.com/registration
the java file uyifl.servlets.Registration is hit and run
(the relationship between url and java class is 
defined in war/WEB-INF/web.xml)

dbl::notice that i did make a small change to your reg.html
so that it pointed to /registration

dbl::we need to start making a pojo
(plain old java object) for the registration form
if you have time start adding data "fields"
to uyifl.pojos.RegForm
