dbl::ok, your page is http://utahyifl.appspot.com/
also, if you go to http://utahyifl.appspot.com/registration
the java file uyifl.servlets.Registration is hit and run
(the relationship between url and java class is 
defined in war/WEB-INF/web.xml)

dbl::notice that i did make a small change to your reg.html
so that it pointed to /registration

dbl::we need to start making a pojo
(plain old java object) for the registration form
if you have time start adding data "fields"
to uyifl.pojos.RegForm

dbl::right now the app *MAY* be saving a little bit of info to the db
i think just first name, last name and some phone numbers
i dont have time to confirm it

dbl::the dashboard for the app is located at 
https://appengine.google.com/dashboard?&app_id=utahyifl
the idea is that in the dashboard you could open the 
datastore viewer to see the objects in there

gda::I have put in fields in the pojo. make sure things are right.  
I was wondering if there is a way to set up to take payments?

gda:: I can't access the db on the dashboard don't know if it is not working 
right. I put in some information on the reg page and it came back with the info
you put in and what I put in.
  
gda:: I have placed a new page called dba1.html for the template and the 
database access page.  We would need to copy and change the page name... maybe not the 
best way to manage that.
