                    Our mission in the UTAH YOUTH INDOOR FOOTBALL LEAGUE, INC. is to allow youth an opportunity 
                    to participate in the game of football on an indoor field, teaching them the fundamentals  
                    of the game and further developing their skills with an emphasis on sportsmanship, teamwork, 
                    discipline, respect and interaction with youth their age while being coached/mentored by  
                    adults who emulate these standards. Every youth who has the wish and desire to play, 
                    regardless of experience, skill or ethnicity, will be afforded that opportunity in the UYIFL.
                    <br/>
                    The UYIFL recognizes that the youth of today are the future leaders of our country and world, 
                    and they will build strength, success, and confidence while participating in our league in  
                    order to reach their great potential. Winning does not make a winner, and losing does not make 
                    a loser...its how you play the game, on and off the field!
